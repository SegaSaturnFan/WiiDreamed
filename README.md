# NullDC4Wii - Faster Dreamcast Emulator for Wii

a fork from https://github.com/skmp/nullDCe

attempting to impliment frame skipping and maybe a few other things

## Things I wanna do

- Player 2-4 Gamecube/Wiimote
- Put external config file for controllers (controls.cfg)
- Frame Skipping

### Developer (Hard)

- Improve gxRend.cpp = main file about specific rendering for Wii
- Splitting gxRend.cpp in multiple files ? (beware this is more tricky than it look)
- Table convertion between SH4 Opcodes of SH4 and the WiiPPC ?
- Use LLVM to port code for PowerPC ?
- Full Dynarec implementation (AI seems to know about this)
- Sound implementation

## Installation

### Put BIOS file and game file

#### Mandatory BIOS files in SD:/data/

- dc_boot.bin  
- dc_flash.bin  
- fsca-table.bin (included)

#### Optional BIOS files in SD:/data/

- dc_flash_wb.bin (this is the dc_flash but already saved)  
- syscalls.bin (needed for elf/bin)
- IP.bin  (needed for elf/bin)

dc_nvmem.bin  
vmu_default.bin  

#### Game file in SD:/discs/

Put your folders with GDI in this directory

CDI doesn't work now

Might work for ISO / BIN / CUE / NRG / MDS

BIN/CUE/ELF, but you probably need IP.bin/syscalls.bin (take IP.TMPL from bootdreams and rename it IP.Bin)


## Configuration

### General configuration

Check nullDC.cfg at root

### Controls

#### Wiimote :

DC - Wii

- A = A  
- B = B  
- Y = 1  
- X = 2  
- START = Home
- D-PAD = D-PAD  
- STICK = Nunchuck Stick
- L = - (and Nunchuck Z)
- R = +  

To Exit : - and +  

#### Gamecube controller :

DC - Gamecube

- A = A  
- B = B  
- Y = Y  
- X = X  
- START = START  
- D-PAD = D-PAD
- STICK = STICK
- L = L  
- R = R


To exit : R + L + Z  



### VMU (Memory card)

I don't know if it's supported now.  

Files appears at root :  
vmu_save_A1.bin  
vmu_save_A2.bin


## Status (13/03/2026)

launch on dolphin an real Wii with FPS between 8 and 50 Fps  
game selector implemented  
1 player controler implemented  
Few games are runnable :
- Castlevania (Demo)
- Sega Tetris
- Shenmue
- Jojo

Wii Dynarec has been improved & completed by AI. Compile but doesn't run (Black Screen). See /archive folder

## Compatibility

https://wiibrew.org/wiki/NullDC4Wii/Compatibility

## Presets

### 🧮 Calculation Accuracy Preset

| Mode | Description |
|------|------------|
| **FAST** | Maximum FPS (higher frame rate), less loading times |
| **BALANCED** | Good balance between speed and accuracy |
| **ACCURATE (default)** | Closest behavior to original hardware |

If you experience Freeze in some heavy games like Shenmue, put FAST or BALANCED. BALANCED may be the default setting in future versions

If you experience various bugs (example that may happens : weird AI controled NPC) put ACCURATE

---

### 🖼️ Graphics Preset

| Mode | Settings | Best platform | 
|------|----------| ------------------------- | 
| **LOW (default from a0.06 to a0.09)** | `GX_NEAR` · `lod_bias 0.0f` · `GX_DISABLE`  | Wii |
| **NORMAL (default from a0.10)** | `GX_LINEAR` · `lod_bias 0.0f` · `GX_DISABLE`  | Wii |
| **HIGH** | `GX_LINEAR` · `lod_bias -0.5f` · `GX_ENABLE` · Anisotropic x2 | Wii U |
| **EXTRA** | `GX_LINEAR` · `lod_bias -1.0f` *(may need to adjust to -0.75)* · `GX_ENABLE` · Anisotropic x4 | Wii U |

While the emulator is still in alpha, the visual difference is limited for now.

- Use LOW for 2D and heavy 3D games
- Use NORMAL for other games

## For Developpers :

### Compilation Process (Makefile)

#### 0/ Download/clone source code

#### 1/ Install devkitpro/devkitPPC

https://wiibrew.org/wiki/DevkitPPC

Just tick PPC (not ARM, x86, etc).

See this issue : https://github.com/BenoitAdam94/nullDC4Wii/issues/13

#### 2/ Launch MSys2 terminal

Devkitpro has it's own UNIX terminal, by default it's located here :  
C:\devkitPro\msys2\usr\bin\mintty.exe

#### 3/ Install additional development packages :

pacman -Syu  # updates MSYS2 and package database  
pacman -S wii-dev

#### 4/ PATH & System variable configuration (Windows)

##### PATH 

In windows variable environnement add C:\devkitPro\devkitPPC\bin to Uservariable PATH

*UPDATE MARCH 2026* :  This folder seems to be needed also for elf2dol : C:\devkitPro\tools\bin

##### System variables

Modify these system variable

DEVKITPPC : C:\devkitPro\devkitPPC  
DEVKITPRO : C:\devkitPro\

**Strongly advise you to completly reboot Windows after that (not just relaunching CMD)**

#### 5/ launch wii/vs_make.bat in a standard CMD windows terminal

Correct errors if they are some errors



#### ~~Use dollz3~~

dollz3 is a compress tool for *.dol files, and it is in the original "vs_make.bat" file, but it seems not to work
